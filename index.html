        <p class = "text">I am a Ukrainian who loves to code and wants to turn her passion into a career. I moved to New York at 17 to study. After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, I worked as a QA engineer and a producer at a NY-based digital marketing agency. Although it was a great learning experience, I knew <strong>I WANTED TO CREATE THINGS MYSELF</strong>. During the pandemic months in New York, I started taking some Web Development classes on Udemy. In 2020 I moved back to my home country and decided it was a perfect time to pursue my interest in Web Development. I took an Intro to Web Development with SoftServe & ScriptJedi42 JavaScript courses.</p>
        <p class = "text"> When I arrived to London, I knew I wanted to continue studying. Therefore, I applied for the futureproof program the first week after my arrival. </p>
